# Customer-Segmentation-using-KMeans-Clustering

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning (KMeans Clustering) to perform customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and identify meaningful segments like high-value customers, frugal buyers, and potential targets for personalized marketing.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

KMeans Clustering from sklearn.cluster

Data Visualization with seaborn and matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for experimentation

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle â€“ Mall Customers Segmentation Data

200 customer records

Features used:

*Annual Income (k$)

*Spending Score (1â€“100)

*standardise Gender

*Age

**Project Workflow**
*Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values & duplicates

Scaled data using StandardScaler

*Finding Optimal Clusters

Used the Elbow Method to determine the best number of clusters (k)

*Model Building

Applied KMeans Clustering

Assigned cluster labels to the original data

*Visualization

Plotted customer segments with color-coded clusters

**ðŸ“Š Cluster Summary**
Cluster Group	Number of Customers
Group 1	24
Group 2	46
Group 3	37
Group 4	54
Group 5	39
Total	200
